#Exercise 1 Creating an object in R 
#Question:

#Create a vector x storing the sequence 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
x = 10:20
#Alternative Method : x <- c(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20)
x
#Add 2 to it. Save the result into a variable called y.
y = x + 2
y

#Multiply y by 3. Save that into a variable called z.
z = y * 3
z
#Subtract 6 from z and divide the result by 3. Save what you get into a variable called answer.
z = (z-6)/3
z
#Print your answer variable.
z
#Try to do the entire operation in a single line of code.
inaline = (((x + 2) * 2) - 6)/3
inaline
